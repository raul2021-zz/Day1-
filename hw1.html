            I am student at the University of California, Berkeley studyind Ethnic Studies and Data Science. Having taken some coding classes at UC Berkeley, I have developed a great interest in working in web development to combine the best of both worlds, a interest in people (the user) and technology.

            I hope that this course will help further my interest in web development. I have previous experience with python, a bit of SQL, some java, I am also learning a bit of R at the moment as well. This has already begun to take up a lot of time, nonetheless, it has been enjoyable making this HTML page.

            I have interests in working with data, learning to cook new recipes, a thirst for learning about societal inequalities, and a joy in running and strength training.
